This is haxx for Super Smash Bros for 3DS, via local-WLAN beacon haxx. The haxx triggers while the application is scanning for local multiplayer sessions, when the beacon is being broadcasted.
In certain cases the application may somewhat hang instead of crashing. Note that in certain cases the haxx may take longer to trigger with the full-game than the demo.

Supported application builds:
* demo: USA+EUR supported and tested.
* v1.0.0. West: supported, only tested with USA.
* v1.0.2. West: not tested.
* v1.0.4. West: supported+tested.

EUR full-game is not supported currently due to different addrs(for v1.0.4 at least).

West = USA/EUR, the full-game .code is basically the same for both it seems. The JPN .code is slightly different.

ctr-wlanbeacontool from here is required: https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-wlanbeacontool

One way to send the beacon is with aireplay-ng, however that requires a patch, see aireplay-ng.patch. For example, to send the beacon with aireplay-ng: aireplay-ng --interactive -r {beaconpcap_path} -h {host mac from pcap} -x 10 {wifi interface}

Note that the smashbrosfullgame_beaconseqX.pcap beacons aren't actually needed.
