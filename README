This is haxx for Super Smash Bros for 3DS, via local-WLAN beacon haxx. The haxx triggers while the application is scanning for local multiplayer sessions, when the beacon is being broadcasted.
In certain cases the application may somewhat hang instead of crashing.

Currently only the demo versions of the application are supported.
