This is haxx for Super Smash Bros for 3DS, via local-WLAN beacon haxx. The haxx triggers while the application is scanning for local multiplayer sessions, when the beacon is being broadcasted.
In certain cases the application may somewhat hang instead of crashing. Note that in certain cases the haxx may take longer to trigger with the full-game than the demo.

Supported application builds:
* demo, tested with USA/EUR(unknown if JPN works with this). Note that while the .code for USA/EUR is different, the two built haxx beacons are identical due to same addrs.
* v1.0.0, tested with USA.
* v1.0.2, not tested.

ctr-wlanbeacontool from here is required: https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-wlanbeacontool

One way to send the beacon is with aireplay-ng, however that requires a patch, see aireplay-ng.patch. For example, to send the beacon with aireplay-ng: aireplay-ng --interactive -r {beaconpcap_path} -h {host mac from pcap} -x 10 {wifi interface}

Note that the smashbrosfullgame_beaconseqX.pcap beacons aren't actually needed.
