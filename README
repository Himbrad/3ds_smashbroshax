This is haxx for Super Smash Bros for 3DS, via local-WLAN beacon haxx. The haxx triggers while the application is scanning for local multiplayer sessions, when the beacon is being broadcasted.
In certain cases the application may somewhat hang instead of crashing.

Currently only the demo versions and the updated version(v1.0.2) of the application are supported. The only region-specific part(for demo builds), if any, is region-specific ROP addrs used in the beacon. Currently no region-specific ROP addrs are used, therefore the final pcap for the demo versions are exactly the same. The .code for v1.0.2 for USA/EUR is about the same, therefore the exact same haxx can be used for both(this probably works for JPN too, however it's unknown whether that's actually the case). The full-game isn't actually fully supported.

ctr-wlanbeacontool from here is required: https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-wlanbeacontool

One way to send the beacon is with aireplay-ng, however that requires a patch, see aireplay-ng.patch. For example, to send the beacon with aireplay-ng: aireplay-ng --interactive -r {beaconpcap_path} -h {host mac from pcap} {wifi interface}

For the full-game, the following must be broadcasted at the same time as the haxx beacon too: smashbrosfullgame_beaconseqX.pcap, where X is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.
